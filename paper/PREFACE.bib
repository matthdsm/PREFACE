The criteria we propose include (1) define-by-run API that allows users to construct the parameter search space dynamically, (2) efficient implementation of both searching and pruning strategies, and (3) easy-to-setup, versatile architecture that can be deployed for various purposes, ranging from scalable distributed computing to light-weight experiment conducted via interactive interface. In order to prove our point, we will introduce Optuna, an optimization software which is a culmination of our effort in the development of a next generation optimization software. As an optimization software designed with define-by-run principle, Optuna is particularly the first of its kind. We will present the design-techniques that became necessary in the development of the software that meets the above criteria, and demonstrate the power of our new design through experimental results and real world applications.

  abstract = {Maternal plasma contains circulating cell-free DNA fragments originating from both the mother and the placenta. The proportion derived from the placenta is known as the fetal fraction. When measured between 10 and 20 gestational weeks, the average fetal fraction in the maternal plasma is 10\% to 15\% but can range from under 3\% to over 30\%. Screening performance using next-generation sequencing of circulating cell-free DNA is better with increasing fetal fraction and, generally, samples whose values are less than 3\% or 4\% are unsuitable. Three examples of the clinical impact of fetal fraction are discussed. First, the distribution of test results for Down syndrome pregnancies improves as fetal fraction increases, and this can be exploited in reporting patient results. Second, the strongest factor associated with fetal fraction is maternal weight; the false negative rate and rate of low fetal fractions are highest for women with high maternal weights. Third, in a mosaic, the degree of mosaicism will impact the performance of the test because it will reduce the effective fetal fraction. By understanding these aspects of the role of fetal fraction in maternal plasma DNA testing for aneuploidy, we can better appreciate the power and the limitations of this impressive new methodology.},

Due to the presence of cfDNA of fetal origin in maternal blood, in silico approaches have been developed to accurately predict fetal aneuploidies. Although NIPT is becoming a new standard in prenatal screening of chromosomal abnormalities, there are no integrated pipelines available to allow rapid, accurate and standardized data analysis in any clinical setting. Several tools have been developed, however often optimized only for research purposes or requiring enormous amount of retrospective data, making hard their implementation in a clinical context. Furthermore, no guidelines have been provided on how to accomplish each step of the data analysis to achieve reliable results. Finally, there is no integrated pipeline to perform all steps of NIPT analysis. To address these needs, we tested several tools for performing NIPT data analysis. We provide extensive benchmark of tools performances but also guidelines for running them. We selected the best performing tools that we benchmarked and gathered them in a computational pipeline. NiPTUNE is an open source python package that includes methods for fetal fraction estimation, a novel method for accurate gender prediction, a principal component analysis based strategy for quality control and fetal aneuploidies prediction. NiPTUNE is constituted by seven modules allowing the user to run the entire pipeline or each module independently. Using two cohorts composed by 1439 samples with 31 confirmed aneuploidies, we demonstrated that NiPTUNE is a valuable resource for NIPT analysis.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study introduces a novel method, referred to as SeqFF, for estimating the fetal DNA fraction in the plasma of pregnant women and to infer the underlying mechanism that allows for such statistical modeling. METHODS: Autosomal regional read counts from whole-genome massively parallel single-end sequencing of circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) from the plasma of 25\,312 pregnant women were used to train a multivariate model. The pretrained model was then applied to 505 pregnant samples to assess the performance of SeqFF against known methodologies for fetal DNA fraction calculations. RESULTS: Pearson's correlation between chromosome Y and SeqFF for pregnancies with male fetuses from two independent cohorts ranged from 0.932 to 0.938. Comparison between a single-nucleotide polymorphism-based approach and SeqFF yielded a Pearson's correlation of 0.921. Paired-end sequencing suggests that shorter ccfDNA, that is, less than 150\,bp in length, is nonuniformly distributed across the genome. Regions exhibiting an increased proportion of short ccfDNA, which are more likely of fetal origin, tend to provide more information in the SeqFF calculations. CONCLUSION: SeqFF is a robust and direct method to determine fetal DNA fraction. Furthermore, the method is applicable to both male and female pregnancies and can greatly improve the accuracy of noninvasive prenatal testing for fetal copy number variation.},

  abstract = {Background Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) is a technique that allows pregnant women to screen for chromosomal abnormalities in their developing fetus without the need for invasive procedures like amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. However, current methods to detect anomaly from maternal cell-free DNAs (cfDNAs) that are based on the sequence read counts calculating z-scores face challenges with false positives and negatives. To address these challenges, we aimed to develop a novel NIPT algorithm named KF-NIPT, which is derived from the initials of k-mer and fetal fraction used in its development with the goal of significantly improving accuracy. Results We developed a KF-NIPT, a new algorithm that estimate chromosomal anomaly by calculating K-mer-based sequence depth and fetal fraction from the whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. Moreover, we implemented a modified preprocessing pipeline for the WGS data, correcting the biases of the genomic mapping quality and the GC contents. The performance of our method was evaluated using publicly available NIPT data. We could demonstrate that our method has better accuracy and sensitivity compared to those of the previous methods. Conclusions We found that using k-mer and fetal fraction reduces errors in NIPT and have integrated this into a pipeline, showing that the traditional read count-based z-score method can be improved. KF-NIPT is implemented in the R and Python environment. The source code is available at https://github.com/eastbrain/KF-NIPT. KF-NIPT has been tested on Ubuntu Linux-64 server and Linux-64 on Windows using a WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

From this same data, fragment size distributions of fetal and maternal DNA fragments can be derived, which are known to be different, and often used to infer fetal fractions. We argue that the fragment size has the potential to aid in the detection of CNVs. By integrating, in parallel, fragment size and read coverage in a within-sample normalization approach, it is possible to construct a reference set encompassing both data types. This reference then allows the detection of CNVs within queried samples, utilizing both data sources. We present a new methodology, WisecondorFF, which improves sensitivity, while maintaining specificity, relative to existing approaches. WisecondorFF increases robustness of detected CNVs, and can reliably detect even at lower fetal fractions ({$<$}2\%).},

The fraction of aligned reads to chromosome Y enables proper quantification for male fetuses, unlike for females, where advanced predictive procedures are required. This study introduces PREdict FetAl ComponEnt (PREFACE), a novel bioinformatics pipeline to establish fetal fraction in a gender-independent manner. METHODS: PREFACE combines the strengths of principal component analysis and neural networks to model copy number profiles. RESULTS: For sets of roughly 1100 male NIPT samples, a cross-validated Pearson correlation of 0.9 between predictions and fetal fractions according to Y chromosomal read counts was noted. PREFACE enables training with both male and unlabeled female fetuses. Using our complete cohort (nfemale = 2468, nmale = 2723), the correlation metric reached 0.94. CONCLUSIONS: Allowing individual institutions to generate optimized models sidelines between-laboratory bias, as PREFACE enables user-friendly training with a limited amount of retrospective data. In addition, our software provides the fetal fraction based on the copy number state of chromosome X. We show that these measures can predict mixed multiple pregnancies, sex chromosomal aneuploidies, and the source of observed aberrations.},

  abstract = {Shallow whole-genome sequencing to infer copy number alterations (CNAs) in the human genome is rapidly becoming the method par excellence for routine diagnostic use. Numerous tools exist to deduce aberrations from massive parallel sequencing data, yet most are optimized for research and often fail to redeem paramount needs in a clinical setting. Optimally, a read depth-based analytical software should be able to deal with single-end and low-coverage data-this to make sequencing costs feasible. Other important factors include runtime, applicability to a variety of analyses and overall performance. We compared the most important aspect, being normalization, across six different CNA tools, selected for their assumed ability to satisfy the latter needs. In conclusion, WISECONDOR, which uses a within-sample normalization technique, undoubtedly produced the best results concerning variance, distributional assumptions and basic ability to detect true variations. Nonetheless, as is the case with every tool, WISECONDOR has limitations, which arise through its exclusiveness for non-invasive prenatal testing. Therefore, this work presents WisecondorX in addition, an improved WISECONDOR that enables its use for varying types of applications.

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Modern data acquisition based on high-throughput technology is often facing the problem of missing data. Algorithms commonly used in the analysis of such large-scale data often depend on a complete set. Missing value imputation offers a solution to this problem. However, the majority of available imputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only: continuous or categorical. For mixed-type data, the different types are usually handled separately. Therefore, these methods ignore possible relations between variable types. We propose a non-parametric method which can cope with different types of variables simultaneously. RESULTS: We compare several state of the art methods for the imputation of missing values. We propose and evaluate an iterative imputation method (missForest) based on a random forest. By averaging over many unpruned classification or regression trees, random forest intrinsically constitutes a multiple imputation scheme. Using the built-in out-of-bag error estimates of random forest, we are able to estimate the imputation error without the need of a test set. Evaluation is performed on multiple datasets coming from a diverse selection of biological fields with artificially introduced missing values ranging from 10\% to 30\%. We show that missForest can successfully handle missing values, particularly in datasets including different types of variables. In our comparative study, missForest outperforms other methods of imputation especially in data settings where complex interactions and non-linear relations are suspected. The out-of-bag imputation error estimates of missForest prove to be adequate in all settings. Additionally, missForest exhibits attractive computational efficiency and can cope with high-dimensional data. AVAILABILITY: The package missForest is freely available from http://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/.

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Gene expression microarray experiments can generate data sets with multiple missing expression values. Unfortunately, many algorithms for gene expression analysis require a complete matrix of gene array values as input. For example, methods such as hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering are not robust to missing data, and may lose effectiveness even with a few missing values. Methods for imputing missing data are needed, therefore, to minimize the effect of incomplete data sets on analyses, and to increase the range of data sets to which these algorithms can be applied. In this report, we investigate automated methods for estimating missing data. RESULTS: We present a comparative study of several methods for the estimation of missing values in gene microarray data. We implemented and evaluated three methods: a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based method (SVDimpute), weighted K-nearest neighbors (KNNimpute), and row average. We evaluated the methods using a variety of parameter settings and over different real data sets, and assessed the robustness of the imputation methods to the amount of missing data over the range of 1--20\% missing values. We show that KNNimpute appears to provide a more robust and sensitive method for missing value estimation than SVDimpute, and both SVDimpute and KNNimpute surpass the commonly used row average method (as well as filling missing values with zeros). We report results of the comparative experiments and provide recommendations and tools for accurate estimation of missing microarray data under a variety of conditions.},

Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) is a widely used Bayesian optimization method in recent parameter tuning frameworks such as Hyperopt and Optuna. Despite its popularity, the roles of each control parameter in TPE and the algorithm intuition have not been discussed so far. The goal of this paper is to identify the roles of each control parameter and their impacts on parameter tuning based on the ablation studies using diverse benchmark datasets. The recommended setting concluded from the ablation studies is demonstrated to improve the performance of TPE.
